# Hack-the-Valley-2018-ZGL-Challenge

Built a Machine Learning model that takes in the opening, high, and low price of ethereum on any given day to predict the closing price. Once trained, it can potentially predict future Ethereum prices.

The Machine Learning model itself is a Dense Neural Network Regression algorithm which was designed using Keras with a Tensorflow backend. 

This **won** the [challenge](https://github.com/zerogravitylabs/hack-the-valley-2018) presented by Zero Gravity Labs at Hack the Valley 2018.
